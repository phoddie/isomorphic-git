# Port of Isomorphic-Git to Moddable SDK
#### Updated May 15, 2020
#### Peter Hoddie

## Introduction

Porting work began April 30, 2020

At this time, the port does nothing useful. But it does build, link, and launch. So, it is a starting point.

### Building and running

- Download the latest Moddable SDK (May 1 or later)
- `cd ${isomorphic-git}/src`
- `./node_modules/.bin/cors-proxy start -p 9998` to launch the CORS proxy (not technically needed, but eliminates TLS as a possible source of error)
- `rm -rf /tmp/moddable-test/ && mcconfig -d -m -p mac` to build for and run on Mac simulator
  - if you get this error (`/moddable/modules/network/http/http.js (193) # Exception: throw!`) then kill and restart the `cors-proxy` from the step above
- `mcconfig -d -m -p esp32` to build for and run on ESP32

> Note: All modules are preloaded. This saves RAM and decreases load time, both critical for embedded targets.

To verify the results run:

```sh
cd /tmp/moddable-test
git verify-pack -v .git/objects/pack/pack-fb367774ad41abbfdc2f4be55149f57987e47eea.idx
```

you should see:

```

### Module specifiers

The original code uses relative paths to import modules. On embedded targets, the Moddable SDK does not support relative paths, only bare module specifiers. All relative path module specifiers needed to build and launch have been converted to bare specifiers. This is incompatible with web hosts. Eventually a better solution is needed

### Resolved issues

- `models/GitConfig.js` - cannot preload as-is because it creates `RegExp` instances at the top level. Worked around with lazy creation of the `RegExp` instances.
- Avoided need for `pify`  implementing promise support directly in host provided FS
- asyncLock relies on `process.domain`. Providing a stub works.
- Code uses `Buffer`, a subclass of Uint8Array Implemented a few needed methods.
- Implemented http object
- Added `console.log` that maps to `trace` for XS
- `BaseError` implements getter/setter to allow error objects to be preloaded (works around "override mistake")
- XS does not support nulls in strings. The `splitAndAssert` code depends on those. Workaround implemented. It looks like this may appear in other places (`readObject`)
- [X] Moddable File is flat FS only.... OK... let's fix that.
  - [x] `createDirectory` implemented for macOS simulator for development
  - [X] FAT32 support for ESP32 added
- [x] SHA module should use Moddable SDK crypto -- smaller and faster

### Open issues 

- Use native miniz instead of pako.
  - [x] inflate, including streaming API
  - [ ] deflate (TODO: do we need this? It's only used for loose object file format)
- `utils/supportsDecompressionStream` is unneeded on Moddable target

### Stub Notes:

#### "utils/sha1": "../packages/stub/sha1"

This seems to work now! To swap in pure JS version, use "./utils/sha1"

####  "pako": "../packages/stub/pako"

This seems to work now! To swap in pure JS version, use "../node_modules/pako/dist/pako.min" (Uses patch in `patches` folder applied by `npm run postinstall`)

####  "utils/toHex": "../packages/stub/toHex"

This seems to work now! To swap in pure JS version, use "./utils/toHex"

####  "crc-32": "../node_modules/crc-32/crc32"

Uses patch in `patches` folder applied by `npm run postinstall`

####  "async-lock": "../packages/async-lock-master/lib/index"

- [ ] TODO: port to a patch

####  "clean-git-ref": "../packages/clean-git-ref-master/src/index"

- [ ] TODO: port to a patch

####  "git-apply-delta": "../packages/git-apply-delta-master/index"

- [ ] TODO: port to a patch
